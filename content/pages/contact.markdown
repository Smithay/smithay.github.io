Title: Contact

Development of the crates hosted by Smithay is mostly done on github, in the
[smithay organisation](https://github.com/Smithay).

Discussions happen either on github issues, or in our chatroom, that you can access via
any of these (they are all bridged together):

- matrix: [#smithay:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#smithay:matrix.org)
- gitter: [smithay/Lobby](https://gitter.im/smithay/Lobby)
- IRC: [#smithay@irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC)

This chatroom is relevant for both discussions about using the crates and
developing them.
